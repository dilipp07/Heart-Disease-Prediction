<h1>Welcome TO Heart Disease Prediction</h1>

<p>The leading cause of death in the developed world is heart disease. Therefore there needs to be work done to help prevent the risks of of having a heart attack or stroke.</p>

<h1>Variable Table</h1>
<p>Age--- Age of the Patient                  </p>
<p>Sex----Sex of the patient  0 for female 1 for male                 </p>
<p>Chest pain type        
    
    -- Value 1: typical angina

    -- Value 2: atypical angina

    -- Value 3: non-anginal pain

    -- Value 4: asymptomatic           </p>
<p>BP---- resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital)      </p>                  
<p>Cholesterol -------serum cholestoral in mg/dl              </p>
<p>FBS over 120 ----- (fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl)  (1 = true; 0 = false)                </p>
<p>EKG results----- 
        resting electrocardiographic results
        -- Value 0: normal

        -- Value 1: having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST elevation or depression of > 0.05 mV)

        -- Value 2: showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria  </p>             
<p>Max Hr----maximum heart rate achieved</p>
<p>Exercise angina---exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)</p>         
<p>ST depression ----------ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest </p>         
<p>Slope of ST --------- 
        the slope of the peak exercise ST segment
    -- Value 1: upsloping
    -- Value 2: flat
    -- Value 3: downsloping</p>                 
<p>Number of vessels fluro----------number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy  </p>    
<p>Thallium ------------ 3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversable defect</p>
